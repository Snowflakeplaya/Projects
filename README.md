## 📝 About the Project

**Pick N' Drop** is a fictional landing page and business website for a premium cleaning and laundry service. The goal of this project was to build a modern, high-performance frontend without relying on heavy frameworks.

The project focuses on **maintainability** and **Scalability**. Instead of duplicating code for the navigation and footer across multiple pages, this project uses the JavaScript `fetch()` API to dynamically inject reusable HTML components.
